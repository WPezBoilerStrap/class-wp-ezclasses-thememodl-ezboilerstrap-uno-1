##### A base modl for the WordPress theme WPezBoilerStrap Uno

The WPezBoilerStrap architecture takes an VMC-esque approach and seperates the details of the presentation (e.g., value for a CSS class) from the actual presentation. Themes are more similar to a shell (or modules) that can be configured (on the fly); the modl supplies the theme the necessary details.

In other words, you can often leave the theme alone and manage changes from within with modl.
